# Forward Inverse Kinematics
This project was meant as a stepping stone to OOP and C++.

#### - Project Status: [Completed]
## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to showcase my understanding of C++ classes and the ability to use external libraries.

### Built with
  * C++
  * [SFML 2.3.2](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) 
  
## Project Description
The project simulates forward and inverse kinematics behaviour, showcasing 4 basic scenarios.
By working on this I deepened my understanding of C++ and OOP, as well as math.
